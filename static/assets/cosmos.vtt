CARL SAGAN:
<i>The cosmos is all there is,</i>

2
00:00:03.588 --> 00:00:04.787
<i>or ever was,</i>

3
00:00:05.285 --> 00:00:06.315
<i>or ever will be.</i>

4
00:00:07.735 --> 00:00:09.069
<i>Come with me.</i>

00:00:10.538 --> 00:00:12.506
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON:
<i>A generation ago,</i>

6
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.908
<i>the astronomer Carl Sagan</i>
<i>stood here</i>

7
00:00:14.943 --> 00:00:16.910
and launched hundreds
of millions of us

8
00:00:16.945 --> 00:00:18.912
on a great adventure--

9
00:00:18.947 --> 00:00:22.749
the exploration of the universe
revealed by science.

10
00:00:22.784 --> 00:00:25.752
It's time to get going again.

11
00:00:25.787 --> 00:00:28.755
We're about to begin a journey
that will take us

12
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.858
from the infinitesimal
to the infinite,

13
00:00:31.893 --> 00:00:34.861
from the dawn of time
to the distant future.

14
00:00:34.896 --> 00:00:39.199
<i>We'll explore galaxies</i>
<i>and suns and worlds,</i>

15
00:00:39.234 --> 00:00:42.236
<i>surf the gravity waves</i>
<i>of space-time,</i>

16
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.606
<i>encounter beings that live</i>
<i>in fire and ice,</i>

17
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.376
<i>explore the planets of stars</i>
<i>that never die,</i>

18
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.979
<i>discover atoms</i>
<i>as massive as suns</i>

19
00:00:52.013 --> 00:00:56.083
<i>and universes smaller</i>
<i>than atoms.</i>

20
00:00:56.117 --> 00:00:59.253
Cosmos<i> is also a story about us.</i>

21
00:00:59.287 --> 00:01:03.423
<i>It's the saga of how wandering</i>
<i>bands of hunters and gatherers</i>

22
00:01:03.458 --> 00:01:08.128
<i>found their way to the stars,</i>

23
00:01:08.162 --> 00:01:11.932
<i>one adventure with many heroes.</i>

24
00:01:20.642 --> 00:01:24.111
To make this journey,
we'll need imagination.

25
00:01:24.145 --> 00:01:26.446
But imagination alone
is not enough

26
00:01:26.481 --> 00:01:29.650
because the reality of nature
is far more wondrous

27
00:01:29.684 --> 00:01:32.019
than anything we can imagine.

28
00:01:36.057 --> 00:01:39.693
This adventure is made possible
by generations of searchers

29
00:01:39.727 --> 00:01:43.197
strictly adhering
to a simple set of rules...

30
00:01:43.231 --> 00:01:47.034
test ideas by experiment
and observation,

31
00:01:47.068 --> 00:01:49.970
build on those ideas
that pass the test,

32
00:01:50.004 --> 00:01:52.206
reject the ones that fail,

33
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.841
follow the evidence
wherever it leads

34
00:01:54.876 --> 00:01:57.511
and question everything.

35
00:01:57.545 --> 00:02:00.013
Accept these terms,

36
00:02:00.048 --> 00:02:03.984
and the cosmos is yours.

37
00:02:04.018 --> 00:02:07.321
Now come with me.

39
00:04:02.304 --> 00:04:04.304
In this ship of
the Imagination,

40
00:04:04.305 --> 00:04:06.907
free from the shackles
of space and time,

41
00:04:06.941 --> 00:04:09.977
we can go anywhere.

42
00:04:10.011 --> 00:04:12.246
If you want to see
where we are in space,

43
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.449
just look out the front window.

44
00:04:19.387 --> 00:04:23.023
In the dimension of time,
the past lies beneath us.

45
00:04:25.326 --> 00:04:29.530
Here's what Earth looked like
250 million years ago.

46
00:04:33.134 --> 00:04:35.703
If you want
to see the future, look up.

47
00:04:35.737 --> 00:04:41.008
And this is how it could appear
250 million years from now.

48
00:04:42.377 --> 00:04:43.811
If we're going
to be venturing out

49
00:04:43.845 --> 00:04:46.680
into the farthest reaches
of the cosmos,

50
00:04:46.715 --> 00:04:49.616
we need to know
our<i> cosmic</i> address,

51
00:04:49.651 --> 00:04:53.353
and this is the first line
of that address.

52
00:04:53.354 --> 00:04:57.012
_

53
00:05:14.542 --> 00:05:18.912
<i>We're leaving the Earth,</i>
<i>the only home we've ever known,</i>

54
00:05:18.947 --> 00:05:23.350
<i>for the farthest reaches</i>
<i>of the cosmos.</i>

55
00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:31.258
<i>Our nearest neighbor,</i>
<i>the Moon, has no sky,</i>

56
00:05:31.292 --> 00:05:34.695
<i>no ocean, no life--</i>

57
00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:38.098
<i>just the scars</i>
<i>of cosmic impacts.</i>

58
00:05:51.112 --> 00:05:54.081
<i>Our star powers the wind</i>
<i>and the waves</i>

59
00:05:54.115 --> 00:05:57.918
<i>and all the life on the surface</i>
<i>of our world.</i>

60
00:05:57.952 --> 00:06:00.521
<i>The Sun holds all the worlds</i>
<i>of the solar system</i>

61
00:06:00.555 --> 00:06:05.092
<i>in its gravitational embrace,</i>
<i>starting with Mercury...</i>

62
00:06:23.645 --> 00:06:27.548
<i>...to cloud-covered Venus,</i>
<i>where runaway greenhouse effect</i>

63
00:06:27.582 --> 00:06:31.185
<i>has turned it</i>
<i>into a kind of hell.</i>

64
00:06:37.125 --> 00:06:38.926
<i>Mars...</i>

65
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.931
<i>a world with as much land</i>
<i>as Earth itself.</i>

66
00:06:56.144 --> 00:06:59.446
<i>A belt of rocky asteroids</i>
<i>circles the Sun</i>

67
00:06:59.481 --> 00:07:01.949
<i>between the orbits</i>
<i>of Mars and Jupiter.</i>

68
00:07:13.461 --> 00:07:17.765
<i>With its four giant moons</i>
<i>and dozens of smaller ones,</i>

69
00:07:17.799 --> 00:07:21.268
<i>Jupiter is like</i>
<i>its own little solar system.</i>

70
00:07:21.303 --> 00:07:25.706
<i>It has more mass than all</i>
<i>the other planets combined.</i>

71
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:39.320
<i>Jupiter's Great Red Spot...</i>

72
00:07:39.354 --> 00:07:42.489
<i>a hurricane three times</i>
<i>the size of our whole planet</i>

73
00:07:42.524 --> 00:07:46.160
<i>that's been raging</i>
<i>for centuries.</i>

74
00:08:06.515 --> 00:08:10.384
<i>The crown jewel</i>
<i>of our solar system, Saturn,</i>

75
00:08:10.418 --> 00:08:13.654
<i>ringed by freeways</i>
<i>of countless orbiting</i>

76
00:08:13.688 --> 00:08:16.056
<i>and slowly tumbling snowballs--</i>

77
00:08:16.091 --> 00:08:20.094
<i>every snowball, a little moon.</i>

78
00:08:50.725 --> 00:08:53.894
<i>Uranus...</i>

79
00:08:53.929 --> 00:08:55.896
<i>and Neptune,</i>

80
00:08:55.931 --> 00:09:00.234
<i>the outermost planets,</i>
<i>unknown to the ancients</i>

81
00:09:00.268 --> 00:09:05.306
<i>and only discovered after</i>
<i>the invention of the telescope.</i>

82
00:09:06.441 --> 00:09:08.809
<i>Beyond the outermost planet,</i>

83
00:09:08.844 --> 00:09:13.514
<i>there's a swarm of tens</i>
<i>of thousands of frozen worlds.</i>

84
00:09:31.032 --> 00:09:33.667
<i>And Pluto is one them.</i>

85
00:09:39.941 --> 00:09:42.343
(whooshing)

86
00:09:46.348 --> 00:09:48.749
<i>Of all our spacecraft,</i>

87
00:09:48.784 --> 00:09:52.086
<i>this is the one that's traveled</i>
<i>farthest from home--</i>

88
00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.322
<i>Voyager 1.</i>

89
00:09:55.357 --> 00:09:59.994
<i>She bears a message</i>
<i>to a billion years from now,</i>

90
00:10:00.028 --> 00:10:02.763
<i>something of who we were,</i>

91
00:10:02.798 --> 00:10:04.932
<i>how we felt</i>

92
00:10:04.966 --> 00:10:06.934
<i>and the music we made.</i>

96
00:10:20.048 --> 00:10:21.882
<i>of this vast cosmic ocean</i>

00:10:21.917 --> 00:10:25.719
<i>and their numberless worlds</i>
<i>lie ahead.</i>

("Dark Was the Night"
continues to play, then fades)

99
00:10:37.641 --> 00:10:41.510
DEGRASSE TYSON: <i>From out here, the
Sun may look like just another star.</i>

100
00:10:41.545 --> 00:10:43.946
But it still exerts
its gravitational hold

101
00:10:43.981 --> 00:10:46.349
on a trillion frozen comets,

102
00:10:46.383 --> 00:10:49.118
<i>leftovers from the formation</i>
<i>of the solar system</i>

103
00:10:49.152 --> 00:10:51.954
<i>nearly five billion years ago.</i>

104
00:10:51.989 --> 00:10:54.590
<i>It's called the Oort Cloud.</i>

105
00:10:54.625 --> 00:10:57.326
<i>No one has ever seen it before,</i>
<i>nor could they,</i>

106
00:10:57.361 --> 00:10:59.595
<i>because each one</i>
<i>of these little worlds</i>

107
00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:01.831
<i>is as far</i>
<i>from its nearest neighbor</i>

108
00:11:01.865 --> 00:11:05.468
<i>as Earth is from Saturn.</i>

109
00:11:05.502 --> 00:11:09.305
This enormous cloud of comets
encloses the solar system,

110
00:11:09.339 --> 00:11:13.142
which is the second line
of our cosmic address.

111
00:11:13.143 --> 00:11:16.947
_

112
00:11:18.048 --> 00:11:21.684
<i>We've only been able to detect</i>
<i>the planets of other stars</i>

113
00:11:21.718 --> 00:11:23.686
<i>for a few decades,</i>

114
00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:27.456
<i>but we already know</i>
<i>that planets are plentiful--</i>

115
00:11:27.491 --> 00:11:30.126
<i>they outnumber the stars.</i>

116
00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.563
<i>Almost all of them will be</i>
<i>very different from Earth,</i>

117
00:11:33.597 --> 00:11:36.065
<i>and hostile</i>
<i>to life as we know it.</i>

118
00:11:36.099 --> 00:11:38.467
<i>But what do we know about life?</i>

119
00:11:38.502 --> 00:11:41.537
<i>We've met only one kind so far.</i>

120
00:11:41.572 --> 00:11:43.506
<i>Earthlife.</i>

121
00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:44.840
See anything?

122
00:11:44.875 --> 00:11:46.842
Just empty space, right?

123
00:11:46.877 --> 00:11:49.645
Human eyes see
only a sliver of the light

124
00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.647
that shines in the cosmos.

125
00:11:51.682 --> 00:11:55.885
But science gives us the power
to see what our senses cannot.

126
00:11:55.919 --> 00:11:58.654
Infrared is
the kind of light made visible

127
00:11:58.689 --> 00:12:00.690
by night-vision goggles.

128
00:12:00.724 --> 00:12:03.359
Throw an infrared sensor
across the darkness...

129
00:12:04.795 --> 00:12:06.395
Rogue planet.

130
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:08.698
World without a sun.

131
00:12:10.601 --> 00:12:15.037
Our galaxy has billions of them,
adrift in perpetual night.

132
00:12:15.072 --> 00:12:18.608
They're orphans, cast away
from their mother stars

133
00:12:18.642 --> 00:12:22.078
during the chaotic birth
of their native star systems.

134
00:12:23.814 --> 00:12:26.449
<i>Rogue planets</i>
<i>are molten at the core</i>

135
00:12:26.483 --> 00:12:28.451
<i>but frozen at the surface.</i>

136
00:12:28.485 --> 00:12:30.453
<i>There may be oceans</i>
<i>of liquid water</i>

137
00:12:30.487 --> 00:12:33.489
<i>in the zone</i>
<i>between those extremes.</i>

138
00:12:38.061 --> 00:12:41.664
<i>Who knows what</i>
<i>might be swimming there?</i>

139
00:12:46.436 --> 00:12:49.605
This is what the Milky Way
looks like in infrared.

140
00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:52.708
Every single dot,
not just the bright ones,

141
00:12:52.743 --> 00:12:54.911
is a star.

142
00:12:54.945 --> 00:12:56.913
How many stars?

143
00:12:56.947 --> 00:12:58.915
How many worlds?

144
00:12:58.949 --> 00:13:01.417
How many ways of being alive?

145

<i>Where are</i> we<i> in this picture?</i>

146
00:13:04.454 --> 00:13:06.889

147
00:13:06.924 --> 00:13:09.091
<i>That's where we live--</i>

<i>about 30,000 light-years</i>
<i>from the center.</i>

<i>We're now a hundred thousand</i>
<i>light-years from home.</i>

152
00:13:19.837 --> 00:13:23.072
<i>It would take light,</i>
<i>the fastest thing there is,</i>

153
00:13:23.106 --> 00:13:26.976
<i>a hundred thousand years</i>
<i>to reach us from Earth.</i>

154
00:13:29.713 --> 00:13:32.114
This is the Great Spiral
in Andromeda,

155
00:13:32.149 --> 00:13:34.116
the galaxy next door.

156
00:13:34.151 --> 00:13:36.119
We call our two giant galaxies

157
00:13:36.153 --> 00:13:38.120
and a smattering
of smaller ones

158
00:13:38.155 --> 00:13:40.490
the "local group."

<i>It's just one of thousands</i>
<i>in the Virgo Supercluster.</i>

162
00:13:55.739 --> 00:13:57.640
<i>On this scale,</i>

163
00:13:57.674 --> 00:14:01.277
all the objects we see,
including the tiniest dots,

164

are galaxies.

165

<i>Each galaxy contains</i>
<i>billions of suns</i>

<i>Yet, the entire</i>
<i>Virgo Supercluster itself</i>

168
00:14:11.488 --> 00:14:14.690
<i>forms but a tiny part</i>
<i>of our universe.</i>

169
00:14:16.393 --> 00:14:20.363
<i>This is the cosmos</i>
<i>on the grandest scale we know--</i>

170
00:14:20.397 --> 00:14:23.699
<i>a network</i>
<i>of a hundred billion galaxies.</i>

00:14:29.206 --> 00:14:30.579
_

174
00:14:30.774 --> 00:14:32.241
<i>Observable</i> universe?!

175
00:14:32.276 --> 00:14:34.143
What does that mean?

176
00:14:34.178 --> 00:14:36.913
Even for us, in our
Ship of the Imagination,

177
00:14:36.947 --> 00:14:40.550
there's a limit to how far
we can see in space-time.

178
00:14:40.584 --> 00:14:42.985
It's our cosmic horizon.

179
00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:46.089
Beyond that horizon
lie parts of the universe

180
00:14:46.123 --> 00:14:48.257
that are too far away.

181
00:14:48.292 --> 00:14:50.259
There hasn't been enough time

182
00:14:50.294 --> 00:14:53.362
in the 13.8 billion year
history of the universe

183
00:14:53.397 --> 00:14:55.898
for their light
to have reached us.

184
00:14:57.935 --> 00:15:01.337
<i>Many of us suspect</i>
<i>that all of this--</i>

185
00:15:01.371 --> 00:15:05.575
<i>all the worlds, stars,</i>
<i>galaxies and clusters</i>

186
00:15:05.609 --> 00:15:08.010
<i>in our observable universe--</i>

187
00:15:08.045 --> 00:15:12.749
<i>is but one tiny bubble</i>
<i>in an infinite ocean</i>

188
00:15:12.783 --> 00:15:14.817
<i>of other universes...</i>

189
00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:18.888
<i>...a multiverse.</i>

190
00:15:18.922 --> 00:15:22.692
<i>Universe upon universe.</i>

191
00:15:22.726 --> 00:15:25.294
<i>Worlds without end.</i>

192
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.068
Feeling a little small?

193
00:15:32.102 --> 00:15:35.571
Well, in the context
of the cosmos, we<i> are</i> small.

194
00:15:35.606 --> 00:15:38.908
We may just be little guys
living on a speck of dust,

195
00:15:38.942 --> 00:15:41.310
afloat in
a staggering immensity,

196
00:15:41.345 --> 00:15:43.446
but we don't think small.

197
00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:46.916
This cosmic perspective
is relatively new.

198
00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:51.220
A mere four centuries ago,
our tiny world was oblivious

199
00:15:51.255 --> 00:15:53.222
to the rest of the cosmos.

200
00:15:53.257 --> 00:15:55.224
There were no telescopes.

201
00:15:55.259 --> 00:15:58.995
The universe was only what you
could see with the naked eye.

202
00:15:59.029 --> 00:16:01.097
Back in 1599,

203
00:16:01.131 --> 00:16:04.467
everyone knew that the Sun,
planets and stars

204
00:16:04.501 --> 00:16:08.504
were just lights in the sky
that revolved around the Earth,

205
00:16:08.539 --> 00:16:12.575
<i>and that we were the center</i>
<i>of a little universe,</i>

206
00:16:12.609 --> 00:16:15.378
<i>a universe made for us.</i>

207
00:16:16.947 --> 00:16:19.315
<i>There was only one man</i>
<i>on the whole planet</i>

208
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:22.185
<i>who envisioned</i>
<i>an infinitely grander cosmos.</i>

209
00:16:22.219 --> 00:16:24.754
<i>And how was</i> he<i> spending</i>
<i>New Year's Eve</i>

210
00:16:24.788 --> 00:16:27.924
<i>of the year 1600?</i>

211
00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:30.793
<i>Why, in prison, of course.</i>

212
00:16:37.855 --> 00:16:40.023
DEGRASSE TYSON:<i> There comes</i>
<i>a time in our lives</i>

213
00:16:40.057 --> 00:16:43.293
when we first realize we're not
the center of the universe,

214
00:16:43.327 --> 00:16:46.529
that we belong to something
much greater than ourselves.

215
00:16:46.564 --> 00:16:48.531
It's part of growing up.

216
00:16:48.566 --> 00:16:50.800
And as it happens to each of us,

217
00:16:50.834 --> 00:16:53.136
so it began to happen
to our civilization

218
00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:55.138
in the 16th century.

219
00:16:55.172 --> 00:16:57.040
<i>Imagine a world</i>
<i>before telescopes,</i>

220
00:16:57.074 --> 00:16:59.309
<i>when the universe</i>
<i>was only what you could see</i>

221
00:16:59.343 --> 00:17:00.843
<i>with the naked eye.</i>

222
00:17:00.878 --> 00:17:04.047
<i>It was obvious that Earth</i>
<i>was motionless,</i>

223
00:17:04.081 --> 00:17:05.782
<i>and that everything</i>
<i>in the heavens--</i>

224
00:17:05.816 --> 00:17:08.117
<i>the Sun, the Moon,</i>
<i>the stars, the planets--</i>

225
00:17:08.152 --> 00:17:10.987
<i>revolved around us--</i>
<i>and then...</i>

226
00:17:11.021 --> 00:17:13.289
a Polish astronomer and priest
named Copernicus

227
00:17:13.324 --> 00:17:17.293
made a radical proposal.
The Earth was not the center.

228
00:17:17.328 --> 00:17:19.796
It was just one of the planets,
and, like them,

229
00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:21.798
it revolved around the Sun.

230
00:17:21.832 --> 00:17:25.134
Many, like the Protestant
reformer Martin Luther,

231
00:17:25.169 --> 00:17:28.137
took this idea as a scandalous
affront to Scripture.

232
00:17:28.172 --> 00:17:30.406
They were horrified.

233
00:17:30.441 --> 00:17:34.878
But for one man,
Copernicus didn't go far enough.

234
00:17:34.912 --> 00:17:38.014
<i>His name was Giordano Bruno,</i>

235
00:17:38.048 --> 00:17:40.517
<i>and he was</i>
<i>a natural-born rebel.</i>

236
00:17:40.551 --> 00:17:43.720
<i>He longed to bust out of that</i>
<i>cramped little universe.</i>

237
00:17:43.754 --> 00:17:46.189
<i>Even as a young Dominican monk</i>
<i>in Naples,</i>

238
00:17:46.223 --> 00:17:48.391
<i>he was a misfit.</i>
<i>This was a time</i>

239
00:17:48.425 --> 00:17:50.727
<i>when there was</i>
<i>no freedom of thought in Italy.</i>

240
00:17:50.761 --> 00:17:52.162
<i>But Bruno hungered to know</i>

241
00:17:52.196 --> 00:17:53.997
<i>everything</i>
<i>about God's creation.</i>

242
00:17:54.031 --> 00:17:56.766
<i>He dared to read the books</i>
<i>banned by the Church,</i>

243
00:17:56.801 --> 00:17:58.568
<i>and that was his undoing.</i>

244
00:17:58.602 --> 00:18:00.603
<i>In one of them,</i>

245
00:18:00.638 --> 00:18:04.741
<i>an ancient Roman, a man dead</i>
<i>for more than 1,500 years</i>

246
00:18:04.775 --> 00:18:07.710
<i>whispered to him</i>
<i>of a universe far greater,</i>

247
00:18:07.745 --> 00:18:10.747
<i>one as boundless</i>
<i>as his idea of God.</i>

248
00:18:14.885 --> 00:18:16.853
<i>Lucretius asked the reader</i>

249
00:18:16.887 --> 00:18:19.255
<i>to imagine standing</i>
<i>at the edge of the universe</i>

250
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:21.257
<i>and shooting an arrow outward.</i>

251
00:18:21.292 --> 00:18:23.560
<i>If the arrow keeps going,</i>
<i>then clearly,</i>

252
00:18:23.594 --> 00:18:26.463
<i>the universe extends beyond</i>
<i>what you thought was the edge.</i>

253
00:18:26.497 --> 00:18:28.898
<i>But if the arrow</i>
<i>doesn't keep going--</i>

254
00:18:28.933 --> 00:18:31.601
<i>say it hits a wall--</i>
<i>then that wall must lie</i>

255
00:18:31.635 --> 00:18:34.571
<i>beyond what you thought</i>
<i>was the edge of the universe.</i>

256
00:18:34.605 --> 00:18:37.907
<i>Now if you stand on</i> that<i> wall</i>
<i>and shoot another arrow,</i>

257
00:18:37.942 --> 00:18:40.643
<i>there are only the same</i>
<i>two possible outcomes...</i>

258
00:18:40.678 --> 00:18:43.046
<i>it either flies forever</i>
<i>out into space,</i>

259
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.048
<i>or it hits some boundary</i>

260
00:18:45.082 --> 00:18:47.817
<i>where you can stand and shoot</i>
<i>yet another arrow.</i>

261
00:18:47.852 --> 00:18:50.420
<i>Either way,</i>
<i>the universe is unbounded.</i>

262
00:18:50.454 --> 00:18:53.723
<i>The cosmos must be infinite.</i>

263
00:18:53.757 --> 00:18:56.226
<i>This made perfect sense</i>
<i>to Bruno.</i>

264
00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.595
<i>The God he worshiped</i>
<i>was infinite.</i>

265
00:18:58.629 --> 00:19:02.465
<i>So how, he reasoned, could</i>
<i>Creation be anything less?</i>

266
00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:03.833
(door opens)

267
00:19:12.476 --> 00:19:13.476
(door opens)

268
00:19:18.115 --> 00:19:20.950
<i>It was the last steady job</i>
<i>he ever had.</i>

269
00:19:24.955 --> 00:19:27.157
(wind whistles softly)

270
00:19:30.361 --> 00:19:32.762
<i>And then, when he was 30,</i>

271
00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:36.433
<i>he had the vision</i>
<i>that sealed his fate.</i>

272
00:19:36.467 --> 00:19:38.935
<i>In this dream,</i>
<i>he awakened to a world</i>

273
00:19:38.969 --> 00:19:42.005
<i>enclosed inside</i>
<i>a confining bowl of stars.</i>

274
00:19:42.039 --> 00:19:45.041
<i>This was the cosmos</i>
<i>of Bruno's time.</i>

275
00:20:03.494 --> 00:20:06.029
<i>He experienced</i>
<i>a sickening moment of fear,</i>

276
00:20:06.063 --> 00:20:07.564
<i>as if the bottom of everything</i>

277
00:20:07.598 --> 00:20:10.200
<i>was falling away</i>
<i>beneath his feet.</i>

278
00:20:10.234 --> 00:20:12.702
<i>But he summoned up his courage.</i>

279
00:20:20.745 --> 00:20:23.546
BRUNO:<i> I spread</i>
<i>confident wings to space</i>

280
00:20:23.581 --> 00:20:27.150
<i>and soared toward the infinite,</i>
<i>leaving far behind me</i>

281
00:20:27.184 --> 00:20:30.520
<i>what others strained to see</i>
<i>from a distance.</i>

282
00:20:30.554 --> 00:20:33.923
<i>Here, there was no up,</i>
<i>no down, no edge,</i>

283
00:20:33.958 --> 00:20:35.492
<i>no center.</i>

284
00:20:35.526 --> 00:20:38.928
<i>I saw that the Sun</i>
<i>was just another star,</i>

285
00:20:38.963 --> 00:20:42.899
<i>and the stars were other Suns,</i>
<i>each escorted by other Earths</i>

286
00:20:42.933 --> 00:20:44.534
<i>like our own.</i>

287
00:20:44.568 --> 00:20:47.837
<i>The revelation</i>
<i>of this immensity was like</i>

288
00:20:47.872 --> 00:20:49.305
<i>falling in love.</i>

289
00:20:52.777 --> 00:20:54.744
DEGRASSE TYSON:
<i>Bruno became an evangelist,</i>

290
00:20:54.779 --> 00:20:58.181
<i>spreading the gospel</i>
<i>of infinity throughout Europe.</i>

291
00:20:58.215 --> 00:21:01.785
<i>He assumed that other lovers</i>
<i>of God would naturally embrace</i>

292
00:21:01.819 --> 00:21:04.854
<i>this grander and more glorious</i>
<i>view of Creation.</i>

293
00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:07.924
BRUNO:
<i>What a fool I was.</i>

294
00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.628
DEGRASSE TYSON:
<i>He was excommunicated</i>

295
00:21:11.662 --> 00:21:13.563
<i>by the Roman Catholic Church</i>
<i>in his homeland,</i>

296
00:21:13.597 --> 00:21:16.032
<i>expelled by the Calvinists</i>
<i>in Switzerland,</i>

297
00:21:16.067 --> 00:21:18.268
<i>and by the Lutherans</i>
<i>in Germany.</i>

298
00:21:18.302 --> 00:21:21.304
<i>Bruno jumped at an invitation</i>

299
00:21:21.339 --> 00:21:24.174
<i>to lecture at Oxford,</i>
<i>in England.</i>

300
00:21:25.576 --> 00:21:27.410
<i>At last, he thought,</i>

301
00:21:27.445 --> 00:21:31.081
<i>a chance to share his vision</i>
<i>with an audience of his peers.</i>

302
00:21:31.115 --> 00:21:33.249
(laughter)

303
00:21:33.284 --> 00:21:35.151
(laughter continues)

304
00:21:35.186 --> 00:21:38.254
I have come to present
a new vision of the cosmos.

305
00:21:38.289 --> 00:21:41.324
Copernicus was right
to argue that our world

306
00:21:41.359 --> 00:21:43.059
is<i> not</i> the center
of the universe.

307
00:21:43.094 --> 00:21:45.128
The Earth goes around the Sun.

308
00:21:45.162 --> 00:21:47.631
It's a planet,
just like the others.

309
00:21:47.665 --> 00:21:49.733
But Copernicus
was only the dawn.

310
00:21:49.767 --> 00:21:51.935
I bring you the sunrise.

311
00:21:53.337 --> 00:21:55.405
The stars are other fiery suns,

312
00:21:55.439 --> 00:21:57.641
made of the same substance
as the Earth,

313
00:21:57.675 --> 00:22:00.677
and they have
their own watery earths,

314
00:22:00.711 --> 00:22:03.780
with plants and animals
no less noble than our own.

315
00:22:03.814 --> 00:22:06.082
Are you mad or merely ignorant?

316
00:22:06.117 --> 00:22:07.851
Everyone knows
there is only one world.

317
00:22:07.885 --> 00:22:10.353
What everyone knows is wrong.

318
00:22:10.388 --> 00:22:13.356
Our infinite God has created
a boundless universe

319
00:22:13.391 --> 00:22:15.258
with an infinite
number of worlds.

320
00:22:15.293 --> 00:22:17.294
Do they not read Aristotle
where you come from?

321
00:22:17.328 --> 00:22:19.029
Or even the Bible?

322
00:22:19.063 --> 00:22:23.667
I beg you, reject antiquity,
tradition, faith, and authority.

323
00:22:23.701 --> 00:22:24.968
Let us begin anew,

324
00:22:25.002 --> 00:22:27.003
by doubting
everything we assume

325
00:22:27.038 --> 00:22:28.138
- has been proven.
- Heretic!

326
00:22:28.172 --> 00:22:29.205
Infidel!

327
00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.107
Your God is too small.

328
00:22:31.142 --> 00:22:33.143
(scholars shouting angrily)

329
00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:39.049
DEGRASSE TYSON: <i>A wiser man
would have learned his lesson.</i>

330
00:22:39.083 --> 00:22:42.385
But Bruno was not such a man.

331
00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:46.656
He couldn't keep his soaring
vision of the cosmos to himself,

332
00:22:46.691 --> 00:22:49.626
despite the fact that
the penalty for doing so

333
00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.662
in his world
was the most vicious form

334
00:22:52.697 --> 00:22:54.698
of cruel and unusual punishment.

335
00:22:58.803 --> 00:23:01.471
Giordano Bruno lived at a time
when there was no such thing

336
00:23:01.506 --> 00:23:03.440
as the separation
of church and state,

337
00:23:03.474 --> 00:23:06.009
or the notion that freedom
of speech was a sacred right

338
00:23:06.043 --> 00:23:07.978
of every individual.

339
00:23:08.012 --> 00:23:10.847
Expressing an idea that didn't
conform to traditional belief

340
00:23:10.882 --> 00:23:13.483
could land you in deep trouble.

341
00:23:15.486 --> 00:23:18.155
Recklessly, Bruno
returned to Italy.

342
00:23:18.189 --> 00:23:19.823
Maybe he was homesick.

343
00:23:19.857 --> 00:23:23.093
But still, he must have known
that his homeland

344
00:23:23.127 --> 00:23:25.195
was one of the most dangerous
places in Europe

345
00:23:25.229 --> 00:23:26.963
he could possibly go.

346
00:23:26.998 --> 00:23:30.033
The Roman Catholic Church
maintained a system of courts

347
00:23:30.068 --> 00:23:31.868
known as the Inquisition,

348
00:23:31.903 --> 00:23:35.439
and its sole purpose
was to investigate and torment

349
00:23:35.473 --> 00:23:39.342
anyone who dared voice views
that differed from theirs.

350
00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:46.316
It wasn't long before Bruno
fell into the clutches

351
00:23:46.351 --> 00:23:48.218
of the thought police.

352
00:23:54.258 --> 00:23:56.893
<i>This wanderer, who worshiped</i>
<i>an infinite universe,</i>

353
00:23:56.928 --> 00:24:00.063
<i>languished in confinement</i>
<i>for eight years.</i>

354
00:24:00.098 --> 00:24:01.898
<i>Through relentless</i>
<i>interrogations,</i>

355
00:24:01.933 --> 00:24:04.634
<i>he stubbornly refused</i>
<i>to renounce his views.</i>

356
00:24:04.669 --> 00:24:06.203
<i>Why was the Church willing</i>

357
00:24:06.237 --> 00:24:09.906
<i>to go to such lengths</i>
<i>to torment Bruno?</i>

358
00:24:09.941 --> 00:24:11.975
<i>What were they afraid of?</i>

359
00:24:12.009 --> 00:24:15.212
<i>If Bruno was right,</i>
<i>then the sacred books</i>

360
00:24:15.246 --> 00:24:17.381
<i>and the authority of the Church</i>

361
00:24:17.415 --> 00:24:20.751
<i>would be open to question.</i>

362
00:24:20.785 --> 00:24:22.486
<i>Finally, the cardinals</i>
<i>of the Inquisition</i>

363
00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.421
<i>rendered their verdict.</i>

364
00:24:24.455 --> 00:24:26.023
CARDINAL BELLARMINE:
You are found guilty

365
00:24:26.057 --> 00:24:28.892
of questioning the Holy Trinity

366
00:24:28.926 --> 00:24:31.595
and the divinity
of Jesus Christ.

367
00:24:31.629 --> 00:24:34.898
Of believing that God's
wrath is not eternal,

368
00:24:34.932 --> 00:24:36.400
that everyone will be saved.

369
00:24:36.434 --> 00:24:41.238
Of asserting the existence
of other worlds.

370
00:24:42.373 --> 00:24:45.275
All of the books
you have written

371
00:24:45.309 --> 00:24:48.779
will be gathered up and burned
in St. Peter's Square.

372
00:24:48.813 --> 00:24:52.382
Reverend Father,
these eight years of confinement

373
00:24:52.417 --> 00:24:53.950
have given me
much time to reflect.

374
00:24:53.985 --> 00:24:54.951
CARDINAL BELLARMINE:
So...

375
00:24:54.986 --> 00:24:56.353
you will recant?

376
00:24:56.387 --> 00:24:58.355
My love and reverence
for the Creator

377
00:24:58.389 --> 00:25:02.025
inspires in me the vision
of an infinite Creation.

378
00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:05.629
You shall be turned over
to the Governor of Rome

379
00:25:05.663 --> 00:25:09.032
to administer
the appropriate punishment

380
00:25:09.067 --> 00:25:11.134
for those who will not repent.

381
00:25:11.169 --> 00:25:13.203
(crowd jeers)

382
00:25:13.237 --> 00:25:17.140
It may be that you
are more afraid

383
00:25:17.175 --> 00:25:20.510
to deliver this judgment
than I am to hear it.

384
00:25:52.777 --> 00:25:55.679
(crowd shouting)

385
00:26:28.646 --> 00:26:30.881
Ten years
after Bruno's martyrdom,

386
00:26:30.915 --> 00:26:33.350
Galileo first looked
through a telescope,

387
00:26:33.384 --> 00:26:36.019
realizing that Bruno
had been right all along.

388
00:26:36.054 --> 00:26:38.789
The Milky Way was made
of countless stars

389
00:26:38.823 --> 00:26:40.524
invisible to the naked eye,

390
00:26:40.558 --> 00:26:44.494
and some of those lights in the
sky were actually other worlds.

391
00:26:44.529 --> 00:26:46.797
Bruno was no scientist.

392
00:26:46.831 --> 00:26:49.299
His vision of the cosmos
was a lucky guess,

393
00:26:49.334 --> 00:26:51.802
because he had
no evidence to support it.

394
00:26:51.836 --> 00:26:55.072
Like most guesses, it could
well have turned out wrong.

395
00:26:55.106 --> 00:26:57.674
But once the idea
was in the air,

396
00:26:57.709 --> 00:26:59.743
it gave others
a target to aim at.

397
00:26:59.777 --> 00:27:01.378
If only to disprove it.

398
00:27:03.414 --> 00:27:07.084
<i>Bruno glimpsed</i>
<i>the vastness of space.</i>

399
00:27:07.118 --> 00:27:11.889
<i>But he had no inkling of the</i>
<i>staggering immensity of time.</i>

400
00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:18.529
How can we humans, who rarely
live more than a century,

401
00:27:18.563 --> 00:27:21.331
hope to grasp
the vast expanse of time

402
00:27:21.366 --> 00:27:23.567
that is the history
of the cosmos?

403
00:27:23.601 --> 00:27:28.372
The universe is
13.8 thousand million years old.

404
00:27:28.406 --> 00:27:30.774
In order to imagine
all of cosmic time,

405
00:27:30.808 --> 00:27:34.444
let's compress it
into a single calendar year.

406
00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:51.564
The cosmic calendar begins on January 1st
with the birth of our universe.

407
00:27:51.599 --> 00:27:54.249
It contains everything that's
happened since then,

408
00:27:54.284 --> 00:27:55.338
up to now,

409
00:27:55.373 --> 00:27:59.891
which on this calendar
is midnight December 31st.

410
00:27:59.926 --> 00:28:03.864
On this scale, every month
represents about a billion years.

411
00:28:03.899 --> 00:28:08.423
Every day represents nearly
40 million years.

412
00:28:08.458 --> 00:28:10.312
Let's go back as far as we can,

413
00:28:10.347 --> 00:28:13.494
to the very first moment
of the universe.

414
00:28:14.436 --> 00:28:18.351
January 1st, the Big Bang.

415
00:28:20.724 --> 00:28:22.655
(explosion)

416
00:28:29.169 --> 00:28:32.291
It's as far back as
we can see in time...

417
00:28:32.964 --> 00:28:34.610
for now.

418
00:28:35.791 --> 00:28:40.528
Our entire universe emerged from
a point smaller than a single atom.

419
00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:43.589
Space itself exploded
in a cosmic fire,

420
00:28:43.623 --> 00:28:45.958
launching the expansion
of the universe

421
00:28:45.992 --> 00:28:48.360
and giving birth
to all the energy

422
00:28:48.394 --> 00:28:50.329
and all the matter
we know today.

423
00:28:50.363 --> 00:28:52.664
I know that sounds crazy,

424
00:28:52.699 --> 00:28:54.633
but there's strong
observational evidence

425
00:28:54.667 --> 00:28:56.268
to support the Big Bang theory.

426
00:28:56.302 --> 00:28:58.771
And it includes the amount
of helium in the cosmos

427
00:28:58.805 --> 00:29:02.441
and the glow of radio waves
left over from the explosion.

428
00:29:02.475 --> 00:29:04.943
As it expanded,
the universe cooled,

429
00:29:04.978 --> 00:29:09.848
and there was darkness
for about 200 million years.

430
00:29:09.883 --> 00:29:12.818
Gravity was pulling together
clumps of gas and heating them

431
00:29:12.852 --> 00:29:15.821
until the first stars
burst into light

432
00:29:15.855 --> 00:29:18.057
on January 10th.

433
00:29:22.996 --> 00:29:26.799
On January 13th,
these stars coalesced

434
00:29:26.833 --> 00:29:31.703
into the first small galaxies.

435
00:29:31.738 --> 00:29:34.540
<i>These galaxies merged</i>
<i>to form still larger ones,</i>

436
00:29:34.574 --> 00:29:37.910
<i>including our own Milky Way,</i>

437
00:29:37.944 --> 00:29:42.381
<i>which formed about</i>
<i>11 billion years ago,</i>

438
00:29:42.415 --> 00:29:45.250
<i>on March 15th of the cosmic year.</i>

439
00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.588
Hundreds of billions of suns.

440
00:29:49.622 --> 00:29:51.423
Which one is ours?

441
00:29:51.458 --> 00:29:53.659
It's not yet born.

442
00:29:53.693 --> 00:29:58.163
It will rise from the ashes
of other stars.

443
00:29:58.198 --> 00:30:01.400
<i>See those lights</i>
<i>flashing like paparazzi?</i>

444
00:30:01.434 --> 00:30:03.869
<i>Each one is a supernova,</i>

445
00:30:03.903 --> 00:30:07.039
<i>the blazing death</i>
<i>of a giant star.</i>

446
00:30:07.073 --> 00:30:10.442
<i>Stars die and are born</i>
<i>in places like this one--</i>

447
00:30:10.477 --> 00:30:12.344
<i>a stellar nursery.</i>

448
00:30:12.379 --> 00:30:14.046
<i>They condense like raindrops</i>

449
00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.715
<i>from giant clouds</i>
<i>of gas and dust.</i>

450
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:19.718
<i>They get so hot</i>
<i>that the nuclei of the atoms</i>

451
00:30:19.753 --> 00:30:22.254
<i>fuse together deep within them</i>

452
00:30:22.288 --> 00:30:25.457
<i>to make the oxygen we breathe,</i>
<i>the carbon in our muscles,</i>

453
00:30:25.492 --> 00:30:28.927
<i>the calcium in our bones,</i>
<i>the iron in our blood,</i>

454
00:30:28.962 --> 00:30:30.729
<i>all of it was cooked</i>

455
00:30:30.764 --> 00:30:34.233
<i>in the fiery hearts</i>
<i>of long-vanished stars.</i>

456
00:30:34.267 --> 00:30:37.970
You, me, everyone--

457
00:30:38.004 --> 00:30:42.441
we are made of star stuff.

458
00:30:44.244 --> 00:30:46.545
<i>This star stuff</i>
<i>is recycled and enriched,</i>

459
00:30:46.579 --> 00:30:48.113
<i>again and again,</i>

460
00:30:48.148 --> 00:30:50.816
<i>through succeeding</i>
<i>generations of stars.</i>

461
00:30:55.088 --> 00:30:57.456
<i>How much longer until</i>
<i>the birth of our Sun?</i>

462
00:30:57.490 --> 00:30:59.258
<i>A long time.</i>

463
00:30:59.292 --> 00:31:00.559
It won't begin to shine

464
00:31:00.593 --> 00:31:03.429
for another six billion years.

465
00:31:05.131 --> 00:31:08.100
<i>Our Sun's birthday is August 31st</i>

466
00:31:08.134 --> 00:31:09.935
<i>on the Cosmic Calendar...</i>

467
00:31:12.472 --> 00:31:14.740
<i>...four and a half</i>
<i>billion years ago.</i>

468
00:31:14.774 --> 00:31:17.242
As with the other worlds
of our solar system,

469
00:31:17.277 --> 00:31:20.346
Earth was formed
from a disk of gas and dust

470
00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:22.514
orbiting the newborn Sun.

471
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:25.985
Repeated collisions produced
a growing ball of debris.

472
00:31:32.392 --> 00:31:33.792
<i>See that asteroid?</i>

473
00:31:33.827 --> 00:31:35.127
<i>No, not that one.</i>

474
00:31:35.161 --> 00:31:36.829
<i>The one over there.</i>

475
00:31:36.863 --> 00:31:40.599
<i>We exist because the gravity</i>
<i>of that one next to it</i>

476
00:31:40.634 --> 00:31:43.769
<i>just nudged it</i>
<i>an inch to the left.</i>

477
00:31:43.803 --> 00:31:45.804
<i>What difference</i>
<i>could an inch make</i>

478
00:31:45.839 --> 00:31:47.873
<i>on the scale the solar system?</i>

479
00:31:47.907 --> 00:31:50.809
<i>Just wait, you'll see.</i>

480
00:31:52.379 --> 00:31:54.179
<i>The Earth took</i>
<i>one hell of a beating</i>

481
00:31:54.214 --> 00:31:56.048
<i>in its first billion years.</i>

482
00:31:59.486 --> 00:32:02.354
<i>Fragments of orbiting debris</i>
<i>collided and coalesced,</i>

483
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:04.990
<i>until they snowballed</i>
<i>to form our Moon.</i>

484
00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:10.696
<i>The Moon is a souvenir</i>
<i>of that violent epoch.</i>

485
00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:13.732
<i>If you stood on the surface</i>
<i>of that long ago Earth,</i>

486
00:32:13.767 --> 00:32:16.468
<i>the Moon would have looked</i>
<i>a hundred times brighter.</i>

487
00:32:16.503 --> 00:32:18.671
<i>It was ten times</i>
<i>closer back then,</i>

488
00:32:18.705 --> 00:32:23.409
<i>locked in a much more intimate</i>
<i>gravitational embrace.</i>

489
00:32:23.443 --> 00:32:26.378
<i>As the Earth cooled,</i>
<i>seas began to form.</i>

490
00:32:26.413 --> 00:32:29.481
<i>The tides were</i>
<i>a thousand times higher then.</i>

491
00:32:29.516 --> 00:32:32.718
<i>Over the eons,</i>
<i>tidal friction within Earth</i>

492
00:32:32.752 --> 00:32:34.853
<i>pushed the Moon away.</i>

493
00:32:40.727 --> 00:32:43.429
Life began
somewhere around here,

494
00:32:43.463 --> 00:32:45.531
September 21st,

495
00:32:45.565 --> 00:32:48.601
three and a half billion
years ago on our little world.

496
00:32:48.635 --> 00:32:50.402
We still don't know
how life got started.

497
00:32:50.437 --> 00:32:52.071
For all we know,

498
00:32:52.105 --> 00:32:54.106
it may have come from
another part of the Milky Way.

499
00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:55.941
The origin of life

500
00:32:55.976 --> 00:32:59.211
is one of the greatest
unsolved mysteries of science.

501
00:33:02.816 --> 00:33:04.850
That's life cooking,

502
00:33:04.885 --> 00:33:07.419
<i>evolving all</i>
<i>the biochemical recipes</i>

503
00:33:07.454 --> 00:33:11.123
<i>for its incredibly</i>
<i>complex activities.</i>

504
00:33:11.157 --> 00:33:16.695
<i>By November 9th,</i>
<i>life was breathing, moving,</i>

505
00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:20.599
<i>eating, responding to</i>
<i>its environment.</i>

506
00:33:20.634 --> 00:33:23.536
<i>We owe a lot</i>
<i>to those pioneering microbes.</i>

507
00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:25.604
<i>Oh, yeah-- one other thing.</i>

508
00:33:25.639 --> 00:33:28.974
<i>They also invented sex.</i>

509
00:33:32.412 --> 00:33:34.580
December 17th was quite a day.

510
00:33:34.614 --> 00:33:37.049
Life in the sea really took off,

511
00:33:37.083 --> 00:33:39.218
it was exploding
with a diversity

512
00:33:39.252 --> 00:33:41.220
of larger plants and animals.

513
00:33:41.254 --> 00:33:46.358
<i>Tiktaalik</i> was one of the first
animals to venture onto land.

514
00:33:48.261 --> 00:33:51.630
It must have felt
like visiting another planet.

515
00:33:53.133 --> 00:33:55.501
Forests, dinosaurs,

516
00:33:55.535 --> 00:33:57.837
birds, insects,

517
00:33:57.871 --> 00:34:01.240
they all evolved
in the final week of December.

518
00:34:01.274 --> 00:34:03.108
The first flower...

519
00:34:03.143 --> 00:34:07.446
bloomed on December 28th.

520
00:34:10.851 --> 00:34:13.586
As these ancient forests
grew and died

521
00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:15.588
and sank beneath the surface,

522
00:34:15.622 --> 00:34:18.457
their remains transformed
into coal.

523
00:34:18.492 --> 00:34:21.093
300 million years later,

524
00:34:21.127 --> 00:34:24.430
we humans are burning
most of that coal to power

525
00:34:24.464 --> 00:34:27.533
and imperil our civilization.

526
00:34:27.567 --> 00:34:29.969
(whooshing)

527
00:34:32.506 --> 00:34:33.873
Remember that asteroid
back in the formation

528
00:34:33.907 --> 00:34:35.541
of the solar system--

529
00:34:35.575 --> 00:34:37.710
the one that got nudged
a little to the left?

530
00:34:37.744 --> 00:34:40.045
Well, here it comes.

531
00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:42.515
<i>It's 6:24 AM</i>

532
00:34:42.549 --> 00:34:46.852
<i>on December 30th</i>
<i>on the Cosmic Calendar.</i>

533
00:34:46.887 --> 00:34:48.354
(impact thundering)

534
00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:55.795
For more than
a hundred million years,

535
00:34:55.829 --> 00:34:58.030
the dinosaurs were lords
of the Earth,

536
00:34:58.064 --> 00:35:00.800
while our ancestors,
small mammals,

537
00:35:00.834 --> 00:35:02.968
scurried fearfully underfoot.

538
00:35:03.003 --> 00:35:05.371
The asteroid changed all that.

539
00:35:05.405 --> 00:35:07.206
Suppose it hadn't
been nudged at all.

540
00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:09.041
It would have missed
the Earth entirely,

541
00:35:09.075 --> 00:35:11.343
and for all we know, the
dinosaurs might still be here

542
00:35:11.378 --> 00:35:12.978
but we wouldn't.

543
00:35:13.013 --> 00:35:15.981
This is a good example
of the extreme contingency,

544
00:35:16.016 --> 00:35:18.751
the chance nature, of existence.

545
00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:23.689
<i>The universe is already</i>
<i>more than 13 and a half</i>

546
00:35:23.723 --> 00:35:25.091
billion years old.

547
00:35:25.125 --> 00:35:26.926
Still no sign of us.

548
00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:31.097
In the vast ocean of time
that this calendar represents,

549
00:35:31.131 --> 00:35:34.200
we humans only evolved
within the last hour

550
00:35:34.234 --> 00:35:39.238
of the last day
of the cosmic year.

551
00:35:44.611 --> 00:35:48.347
<i>11:59 and 46 seconds.</i>

552
00:35:48.382 --> 00:35:52.585
All of recorded history occupies
only the last 14 seconds,

553
00:35:52.619 --> 00:35:55.354
and every person
you've ever heard of

554
00:35:55.389 --> 00:35:57.390
lived somewhere in there.

555
00:35:59.259 --> 00:36:03.195
All those kings and battles,
migrations and inventions,

556
00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:07.700
wars and loves,
everything in the history books

557
00:36:07.734 --> 00:36:09.769
happened here,
in the last seconds

558
00:36:09.803 --> 00:36:11.871
of the Cosmic Calendar.

559
00:36:11.905 --> 00:36:14.073
But if we want to explore

560
00:36:14.107 --> 00:36:16.642
such a brief moment
of cosmic time...

561
00:36:19.279 --> 00:36:21.347
...we'll have to change scale.

562
00:36:38.211 --> 00:36:40.579
We are newcomers to the cosmos.

563
00:36:40.613 --> 00:36:45.017
Our own story only begins on the
last night of the cosmic year.

564
00:36:45.051 --> 00:36:48.420
It's 9:45 on New Year's Eve.

565
00:36:48.454 --> 00:36:50.856
Three and a half
million years ago,

566
00:36:50.890 --> 00:36:54.793
our ancestors, yours and mine,
left these traces.

567
00:36:56.162 --> 00:36:59.798
We stood up,
and parted ways from them.

568
00:36:59.832 --> 00:37:01.733
Once we were standing
on two feet,

569
00:37:01.768 --> 00:37:04.903
our eyes were no longer
fixated on the ground.

570
00:37:04.937 --> 00:37:08.573
Now we were free
to look up in wonder.

571
00:37:11.177 --> 00:37:13.645
For the longest part
of human existence,

572
00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:17.416
say the last 40,000 generations,

573
00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:19.251
we were wanderers,

574
00:37:19.285 --> 00:37:22.454
living in small bands
of hunters and gatherers,

575
00:37:22.488 --> 00:37:25.123
making tools, controlling fire,

576
00:37:25.158 --> 00:37:27.125
naming things,

577
00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:31.496
all within the last hour
of the Cosmic Calendar.

578
00:37:39.639 --> 00:37:43.108
To find out what happens next,
we'll have to change scale

579
00:37:43.142 --> 00:37:46.311
to see the last minute
of the last night

580
00:37:46.346 --> 00:37:49.348
of the cosmic year.

581
00:37:49.382 --> 00:37:51.350
11:59.

582
00:37:51.384 --> 00:37:54.019
We're so very young on
the time scale of the universe

583
00:37:54.053 --> 00:37:56.655
that we didn't start painting
our first pictures

584
00:37:56.689 --> 00:38:00.259
until the last 60 seconds
of the cosmic year,

585
00:38:00.293 --> 00:38:03.795
a mere 30,000 years ago.

586
00:38:12.038 --> 00:38:14.606
<i>This is when</i>
<i>we invented astronomy.</i>

587
00:38:14.641 --> 00:38:17.809
<i>In fact, we're all descended</i>
<i>from astronomers.</i>

588
00:38:17.844 --> 00:38:21.213
<i>Our survival depended on</i>
<i>knowing how to read the stars</i>

589
00:38:21.247 --> 00:38:23.549
<i>in order to predict</i>
<i>the coming of the winter</i>

590
00:38:23.583 --> 00:38:26.184
<i>and the migration</i>
<i>of the wild herds.</i>

591
00:38:26.219 --> 00:38:29.187
<i>And then,</i>
<i>around 10,000 years ago,</i>

592
00:38:29.222 --> 00:38:32.190
<i>there began a revolution</i>
<i>in the way we lived.</i>

593
00:38:32.225 --> 00:38:35.460
<i>Our ancestors learned</i>
<i>how to shape their environment,</i>

594
00:38:35.495 --> 00:38:37.863
<i>taming wild plants and animals,</i>

595
00:38:37.897 --> 00:38:40.866
<i>cultivating land</i>
<i>and settling down.</i>

596
00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:43.468
<i>This changed everything.</i>

597
00:38:43.503 --> 00:38:45.470
<i>For the first time</i>
<i>in our history,</i>

598
00:38:45.505 --> 00:38:48.874
<i>we had more stuff</i>
<i>than we could carry.</i>

599
00:38:48.908 --> 00:38:51.310
<i>We needed a way</i>
<i>to keep track of it.</i>

600
00:38:51.344 --> 00:38:53.512
<i>At 14 seconds to midnight,</i>

601
00:38:53.546 --> 00:38:57.015
<i>or about 6,000 years ago,</i>
<i>we invented writing.</i>

602
00:38:57.050 --> 00:38:59.518
<i>And it wasn't long</i>
<i>before we started recording</i>

603
00:38:59.552 --> 00:39:01.253
<i>more than bushels of grain.</i>

604
00:39:01.287 --> 00:39:03.255
<i>Writing allowed us</i>
<i>to save our thoughts</i>

605
00:39:03.289 --> 00:39:06.525
<i>and send them much further</i>
<i>in space and time.</i>

606
00:39:06.559 --> 00:39:08.927
<i>Tiny markings on a clay tablet</i>

607
00:39:08.962 --> 00:39:12.197
<i>became a means for us</i>
<i>to vanquish mortality.</i>

608
00:39:12.232 --> 00:39:15.334
<i>It shook the world.</i>

609
00:39:15.368 --> 00:39:18.437
<i>Moses was born</i>
<i>seven seconds ago.</i>

610
00:39:18.471 --> 00:39:21.373
<i>Buddha, six seconds ago.</i>

611
00:39:21.407 --> 00:39:24.276
<i>Jesus, five seconds ago.</i>

612
00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:27.713
<i>Mohammed, three seconds ago.</i>

613
00:39:27.747 --> 00:39:31.116
<i>It was not even two seconds ago</i>
<i>that, for better or worse,</i>

614
00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:34.453
<i>the two halves of the Earth</i>
<i>discovered each other.</i>

615
00:39:34.487 --> 00:39:36.722
<i>And it was only</i>
<i>in the very last second</i>

616
00:39:36.756 --> 00:39:39.725
<i>of the Cosmic Calendar</i>
<i>that we began to use science</i>

617
00:39:39.759 --> 00:39:42.895
<i>to reveal nature's secrets</i>
<i>and her laws.</i>

618
00:39:42.929 --> 00:39:45.631
<i>The scientific method</i>
<i>is so powerful</i>

619
00:39:45.665 --> 00:39:47.633
<i>that in a mere four centuries,</i>

620
00:39:47.667 --> 00:39:50.969
<i>it has taken us from Galileo's</i>
<i>first look through a telescope</i>

621
00:39:51.004 --> 00:39:54.473
<i>at another world to leaving</i>
<i>our footprints on the Moon.</i>

622
00:39:54.507 --> 00:39:58.977
<i>It allowed us to look out</i>
<i>across space and time</i>

623
00:39:59.012 --> 00:40:04.750
<i>to discover where</i>
<i>and when we are in the cosmos.</i>

624
00:40:04.784 --> 00:40:09.321
CARL SAGAN: <i>We are a way for
the cosmos to know itself.</i>

625
00:40:09.355 --> 00:40:11.657
Carl Sagan guided
the maiden voyage of<i> Cosmos</i>

626
00:40:11.691 --> 00:40:13.425
a generation ago.

627
00:40:13.459 --> 00:40:15.627
He was the most successful
science communicator

628
00:40:15.662 --> 00:40:17.129
of the 20th century,

629
00:40:17.163 --> 00:40:19.898
but he was first and foremost
a scientist.

630
00:40:19.933 --> 00:40:23.435
<i>Carl contributed enormously</i>

631
00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:25.637
<i>to our knowledge</i>
<i>of the planets.</i>

632
00:40:25.672 --> 00:40:28.640
<i>He correctly predicted</i>
<i>the existence of methane lakes</i>

633
00:40:28.675 --> 00:40:30.642
<i>on Saturn's giant moon Titan.</i>

634
00:40:30.677 --> 00:40:33.946
<i>He showed that the atmosphere</i>
<i>of the early Earth</i>

635
00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:36.915
<i>must have contained</i>
<i>powerful greenhouse gases.</i>

636
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:40.919
<i>He was the first to understand</i>
<i>that seasonal changes on Mars</i>

637
00:40:40.954 --> 00:40:43.422
<i>were due to windblown dust.</i>

638
00:40:43.456 --> 00:40:44.990
<i>Carl was a pioneer</i>

639
00:40:45.024 --> 00:40:46.425
<i>in the search</i>
<i>for extraterrestrial life</i>

640
00:40:46.459 --> 00:40:49.328
<i>and intelligence.</i>

641
00:40:49.362 --> 00:40:52.631
<i>He played a leading role in</i>
<i>every major spacecraft mission</i>

642
00:40:52.665 --> 00:40:55.134
<i>to explore the solar system</i>
<i>during the first 40 years</i>

643
00:40:55.168 --> 00:40:57.536
<i>of the Space Age.</i>

644
00:40:59.305 --> 00:41:02.174
But that's not all he did.

645
00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:08.514
This is Carl Sagan's
own calendar from 1975.

646
00:41:10.483 --> 00:41:13.485
Who was I back then?

647
00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:16.321
I was just a 17-year-old kid
from the Bronx

648
00:41:16.356 --> 00:41:18.724
with dreams
of becoming a scientist,

649
00:41:18.758 --> 00:41:22.060
and somehow the world's most
famous astronomer found time

650
00:41:22.095 --> 00:41:24.897
to invite me to Ithaca,
in upstate New York,

651
00:41:24.931 --> 00:41:26.698
and spend a Saturday with him.

652
00:41:26.733 --> 00:41:30.135
I remember that snowy day
like it was yesterday.

653
00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:31.970
He met me at the bus stop

654
00:41:32.005 --> 00:41:34.873
and showed me his laboratory
at Cornell University.

655
00:41:34.908 --> 00:41:39.344
Carl reached behind his desk
and inscribed this book for me.

656
00:41:43.082 --> 00:41:45.751
"For Neil, a future astronomer.

657
00:41:45.785 --> 00:41:47.586
Carl."

658
00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:51.023
At the end of the day, he drove
me back to the bus station.

659
00:41:51.057 --> 00:41:53.025
The snow was falling harder.

660
00:41:53.059 --> 00:41:55.027
He wrote his phone number--
his home phone number--

661
00:41:55.061 --> 00:41:58.530
on a scrap of paper and he said,
"If the bus can't get through,

662
00:41:58.565 --> 00:42:02.367
call me and spend the night
at my home with my family."

663
00:42:02.402 --> 00:42:05.204
I already knew I wanted
to become a scientist,

664
00:42:05.238 --> 00:42:07.606
but that afternoon,
I learned from Carl

665
00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:09.875
the kind of person
I wanted to become.

666
00:42:09.909 --> 00:42:13.545
He reached out to me
and to countless others,

667
00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:18.050
inspiring so many of us
to study, teach and do science.

668
00:42:18.084 --> 00:42:20.452
Science is
a cooperative enterprise,

669
00:42:20.487 --> 00:42:22.855
spanning the generations.

670
00:42:22.889 --> 00:42:27.192
It's the passing of a torch from
teacher to student to teacher,

671
00:42:27.227 --> 00:42:30.696
a community of minds
reaching back to antiquity

672
00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:32.698
and forward to the stars.

673
00:42:32.732 --> 00:42:35.534
Now, come with me.

674
00:42:35.568 --> 00:42:38.971
Our journey is just beginning.
